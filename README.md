# Predicting-Credit-Card-Fraud-Python

The code is using a Logistic Regression machine learning model to predict whether a financial transaction is fraudulent or not. The data for the transactions is loaded from a CSV file and then some additional columns are created to represent important information about each transaction. 

The data is split into a training set and a testing set and the features are normalized. The Logistic Regression model is then fit to the training data. The model is scored on both the training data and the testing data. Finally, some new transactions are created and added to the model to predict if they are fraudulent or not. The code also outputs the probabilities that each new transaction is fraudulent.
